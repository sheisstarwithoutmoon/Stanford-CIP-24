# Wordle Game

Welcome to the Wordle Game! This is a simple clone of the popular word guessing game where you have to guess a hidden five-letter word in six tries or less. Each guess provides feedback on which letters are correct and in the correct position, which are correct but in the wrong position, and which are incorrect.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Feedback on guesses to help you find the hidden word
- Keeps track of your guess count
- Playable on web browsers

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Enter a five-letter word as your guess and submit it.
3. The game will provide feedback for each letter:
    - **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
    - **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
    - **White**: The letter is not in the word.
4. Use the feedback to guess the word within six tries.
5. If you guess the word correctly within six tries, you win!
6. If you don't guess the word within six tries, you lose, and the correct word is revealed.
